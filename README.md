# AWS Services used

Route 53 - This is added to the domain to manage the traffic from different regions and reroute the traffic to different load balancers that are created.
ELB - Three different load balancers are used in the current project . Two of the load balancers are in the region us-east-1.
S3, cloud front - S3 storage is used for storing the files and cross region replication is done such that all the files that were uploaded are simultaneously replicated in different regions. Thus ensuring a reliable solution for storing the files. Cloud front is also added in front of the S3 such that users would get a faster download option.
Lambda - Lambda function is created to trigger the event whenever there is a delete in the S3 bucket  for the application.
SNS, Cloud watch -  An sns topic is created with the event subscription to let the customer know / notify in the email whenever there is an object delete.
DR Measures- for the disaster recovery purpose , we have created a replica in a different region for the S3 and also added the new load balancer to point out the application running in different region.
Highly available - By adding the replication with different regions and load balancers pointing the application is highly available.
Highly scalable - An auto scaling group is added infront to ensure the scaling of the instances whenever the instance is down.
Version control - For the current project , Github is used for the version control and a git repository is made for the website and all the code is pushed into it.
